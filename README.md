# AFE-Module
Analog Front-End (AFE) design for precision sensor interfacing. Features a 3-stage Op-Amp topology: active low-pass filtering, 11x non-inverting gain, and 0.9V DC biasing for 3.3V ADC compatibility. Optimized for low-power applications [1-10mV noisy signal] with verified signal integrity via real-time SPICE simulation.
